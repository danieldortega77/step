  <h3>South Coast Plaza</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most upscale places I've ever been. A little out of place among
    all the adults shopping at Gucci and Rolex, my friends and I went here
    every once in a while to feel like we might be able to buy something. If
    anything else, it's fun to walk around here.
