  <h3>Edwards Cinemas</h3>
  <p>
    My favorite movie theater to go to. It's right next to a food court, so you
    don't have to buy overpriced food from the theater! There's also a 99 cent
    store nearby if you really want to cut the cash. I went here very frequently
    with my friends while in high school.
