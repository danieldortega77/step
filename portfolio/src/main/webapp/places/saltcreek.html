  <h3>Salt Creek Beach</h3>
  <p>
    Talk about a nice view. This is where you would want to go for relaxation
    by the sea. I can't vouch for the beach itself because I don't usually go
    beyond the massive patch of green where you can feel the ocean breeze, smell
    the sea salt, and watch the sunset.
